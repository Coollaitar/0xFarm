## ⛔Challenges we ran into:

We ran into problems regarding integration due to improper docuementation

## ⚙️Technologies we used:

- [x] Solidity
- [x] Javascript
- [x] ethers.js
- [x] Remix(IDE)
- [x] React.js
- [x] Hardhat

## 🌐Platforms this project is built for:

- [x] Web

## 🪧Protocol Used:

- [x] Arcana
- [x] Push Protocol

## 🔦Reason for using **Arcana**:

We have implemented **Arcana** auth for easy onboarding of users on our Dapp.
The user can seamlessly log in to our app using Arcana auth even if he doesn't have Wallet.
We have used Arcana AuthSDK Rainbowkit Connector for our dApp for users to connect to dApp using Arcana.

## 🔦Reason for using Push Protocol:

**0xFarm** has integrated the Push protocol for chatting with farmers and receiving notifications into dApp.
**𝐏𝐮𝐬𝐡 𝐂𝐡𝐚𝐭** :
Users can chat with farmers and ask about their lands.
**𝐏𝐮𝐬𝐡 𝐍𝐨𝐭𝐢𝐟𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧**:
When a lender lends money, he gets a notification about land. Also, the borrower gets a notification when he lists his farm. Both people also get notifications about the repayment.

We have used pushprotocol/uiembed for Notifications
And @pushprotocol/uiweb as well as @pushprotocol/restapi for integrating push chat
